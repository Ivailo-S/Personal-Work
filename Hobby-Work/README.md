## Hobby-Work:

This contains my collection of personal mods that I have created, most of which have been posted to the Steam Workshop while some others were left for personal use.
These mods used lua as its coding language, along with some xml. I used Blender for the modelling, Paint.net for texturing, and Audacity for audio work.

To see (most) of these mods posted online, you can go to https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198356412893/myworkshopfiles/ to see my full catalogue, including a collaboration with another modder.
