## Hello whoever is reading this!

Provided in this GitHub page is all of my personal coding projects, both as leisure and from education. Much of this has been relatively organized for your browsing, and all projects should be able to be downloaded and run on your system directly with no trouble (Provided you have the necessary software that will be associated with each content folder.

Absolutely everything in this repository has been made by me, with the exceptions of some using libraries that would build off of them. 3D models, texture files, and (most) of the code provided has been built by me, and other things like audio files and code frameworks have been modified for this usage. Personal projects will largely be tied with a Steam Workshop link where it's already publically available for use, whilst school work has been largely closed quarters for anything I've done in my educational journey.

Thank you for reading this overview, and I hope you have a good time perusing through this repository!
